I finished work as usual, put my coat on and left the office. I decided to walk home for a change because it was a sunny day. I turned the corner and was going to go up my drive but didn't because I couldn't. Why so? My house wasn't there! It had just disappeared! I couldn't believe in it! There was a gap where my house had stood, a completely empty space. My neighbour's house (bwoah) was there and her car was also. I decided to take some action straight away, I went to the old lady, and knocked on her front door. She came to the door, opened it and asked 'Who you are?' I said 'I am your neighbour. I've lived here for ten years'. She looked at me but didn't seem to recognise me and she said 'I don't know you and I don't wanna to know you. Now go away.' She slammed the door and left me on the doorstep
